# Agile development dev-blog

## Wednesday, 26th October at 11:00 AM

I watched the first course lecture. Basic course information was
introduced, and apparently actual work is at least a week away. We do
not yet know what we are supposed to work on, or how exactly.

I would assume we do get to work on a game, hopefully using Unreal Engine 5.

I created a clockify workspace and project for the agile project.

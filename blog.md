I watched the first course lecture. Basic course information was
introduced, and apparently actual work is at least a week away. We do
not yet know what we are supposed to work on, or how exactly.

I would assume we do get to work on a game, hopefully using Unreal Engine 5.

I created a clockify workspace and project for the agile project.

-> Overall time spent: 1h 20 min

I watched the second lecture. Honestly, felt like mostly a waste of time.
We were vaguely introduced to the assingment we will be given. In my case,
presumably, I will be programming a game designed by children.

Updated clockify.

-> Overall time spent: 2h 30 min

I studied Scrum and the Scrum-master role for a couple hours in
preparation for the project starting.

I also read up on related emails and joined the Azure Dev Ops group. I
briefly looked at the tasks already listed there, and communicated with
my team, asking them what roles they would prefer. Currently there is
one member, Panu, still missing from our Discord server. I sent an invite
to him about a week ago.

I don't think the 1st sprint has officially started yet, even though
it's been about 2 weeks since the start of the course. Tomorrow, we
are probably going to get some guidance on what to do, and can begin
work. One of the first things to do will be to contact Jyri Martiskainen.

I am not quite sure what sort of collaboration we will have with
the children. Are we going to meet them weekly, or just once in the
beginning? I guess we will find out tomorrow. As of now, I also have no
idea what sort of game they might want us to make.

Updated clockify.

-> Overall time spent: 3h 57 min

# Agile development dev-blog, 2022

## Wednesday, 26th October at 11:00 AM

I watched the first course lecture. Basic course information was
introduced, and apparently actual work is at least a week away. We do
not yet know what we are supposed to work on, or how exactly.

I would assume we do get to work on a game, hopefully using Unreal Engine 5.

I created a clockify workspace and project for the agile project.

-> Overall time spent: 1h 20 min


## Monday, 31st October at 09:45 AM

I watched the second lecture. Honestly, felt like mostly a waste of time.
We were vaguely introduced to the assingment we will be given. In my case,
presumably, I will be programming a game designed by children.

Updated clockify.

-> Overall time spent: 2h 30 min

## Tuesday, 8th November at 05:00 AM

I studied Scrum and the Scrum-master role for a couple hours in
preparation for the project starting.

I also read up on related emails and joined the Azure Dev Ops group. I
briefly looked at the tasks already listed there, and communicated with
my team, asking them what roles they would prefer. Currently there is
one member, Panu, still missing from our Discord server. I sent an invite
to him about a week ago.

I don't think the 1st sprint has officially started yet, even though
it's been about 2 weeks since the start of the course. Tomorrow, we
are probably going to get some guidance on what to do, and can begin
work. One of the first things to do will be to contact Jyri Martiskainen.

I am not quite sure what sort of collaboration we will have with
the children. Are we going to meet them weekly, or just once in the
beginning? I guess we will find out tomorrow. As of now, I also have no
idea what sort of game they might want us to make.

Updated clockify.

-> Overall time spent: 3h 57 min

## Wednesday, 9th November at 15:00 (03:00 PM)

Watched the lecture, it went over some Azure stuff. I feel okay about
using Azure.

At 13:30 our group held a meeting. Everyone was present.
- Herbert
- Jasu
- Jasper
- Panu
- Asmo

I reserved the Teams meeting date and time for our group on the 10th,
from 09:15 to 10:15. An email was sent to everyone involved. Everyone
accepted the invite.

Panu sent an email to Jyri, our client. We plan to meet on Monday (14th)
or Tuesday (15th) to discuss further.

We also received Admin rights to the Azure DevOps project. Planning the
tasks will begin once it is more clear to us what we need to do.

Updated clockify.

-> Overall time spent: 7h 17 min

### Työpanos ja sitoutuminen

#### My Tasks

I track the tasks I need to complete in my personal notes, and I spend
a number of hours completing the tasks.

#### Evenly split work

- Asmo will create background art.
- Jasper and Jasu will work on player and enemy characters.
- Panu is handling the Product Owner's tasks and will create the introduction for our game.
- I, Herbert, will oversee the other's work, and help where needed. I
am at least partially responsible for creating backlog items and tasks
in Azure. I also keep updating the Wiki, hold the daily scrum,
retrospective meetings and the sprint planning sessions, and will
help with programming the player character, items, and weapons. I
will attempt to keep the project organized and help in planning the
architecture.

#### Group guidelines and agreed upon plans

I keep note of dates and times when we are supposed to be having meetings
or such, I intend to be there on time, and if I can not attend a meeting
for some reason, I will contact my team.

#### Relationship of Work to Goals of Project

I try to keep my priorities aligned with the vision of the product. I
write each task with thought and intent, thinking of how to split work
in suitable chunks. I help the team make constant progress, and dissolve
any roadblocks by communicating with the team and working hard.

#### Equality in Distribution of Work

I believe we can share the workload quite evenly. So far, I might have
done the most, but I intend to push the others to work a bit more if I
see them slacking. I will not do or shoulder everything myself.

The first tasks have just recently been assinged, so it is hard to
judge the equality of the workloads. I will keep an eye on it and adjust
accordingly.

#### Other groups

I have no idea how to become familiar with other groups work. I have no
access to their group chats or Azure. I was under the impression that
we are not really communicating with the other teams.

#### Importance of My Work to Success of Project

I think my work is important. I can look at some graphs on Azure which
show that I contribute to the project. Creating good backlog items and
tasks can help the team progress faster.

#### Advancing Equality in Distribution of Work

If someone looks like they might not be working much, I will try to get
them to do something. I can assign some easy tasks to lessen the burden
of entry. If someone wants to maybe do more work, I don't discourage it.

Complete equality and fairness is an impossible goal. As long as everyone
does their part, the project will succeed. If anyone raises concerns
regarding the fairness in distribution, I will attempt to solve the
problem.

#### Implementing Behavior from Other Groups into Ours

I do not implement good practices from other groups, because we have no
idea what the others are doing.

### Work tracking

#### Tracking My Usage of Time

I track time using Clockify and I update the time on my Dev-Blog. I have
created multiple categories and tags on Clockify so that I can see where
time is being spent. For example, I track development, meeting, writing,
DevOps and lecture times separately.

The time spent of various tasks can be fetched from Clockify for the
duration of each sprint.

I have not enabled billing in Clockify, as I am not actually being
billed, I do not see it as relevant. Calculating the time afterwards is
also completely possible using a simple formula: *hours * hourly-pay*. I
also dislike the idea of pay per hour, which encourages working as much
as possible and lying about how much you've worked, while discouraging
and lowering the value of highly productive work.

### Reflektio

#### My Role

My role as the Scrum-master is to upkeep scrum within the team. I hold
the scrum, sprint retrospective, and sprint planning meetings. I also
work on scrum checklist and actively try to get my team to work more
effectively.

#### Scrum-master

I read about the Scrum-master role, and watched a number of videos on Youtube.

#### Responsibilities

#### How do you make sure you uphold your responsibilities?

I communicate actively with my team. I try to work hard. I don't want
to completely dissapoint people around me. I also want to get an okay
grade.

#### Areas with Room for Development

I do not know how to do better.

#### Strengths

I am active and skilled. My communication is hopefully okay.

### My Tasks

#### Tasks as Scrum-master

I hold the daily scrum, retrospective meetings and take part in sprint
planning. I keep updating the scrum process tasks on Azure. I communicate
with the team and help them out if they need any help. I also do a bit
of programming.

#### Keeping Track of Tasks

I write everything down. I mark tasks as TODO or DONE. Of course we also
actively use Azure DevOps, which allows us to track tasks.

#### Improving Based on Previous Experience

I learned a lot about scrum and agile practices, and about Azure DevOps.
I can utilize these tools more effectively now.

### Viestintä

#### Contact with Group

I message the group every day on Discord, I update tasks on Azure and
I hold the daily scrum. I respond to the groups messages as soon as
possible.

I try to gauge how others react to my communication and adjust
accordingly. If they were to tell me I am doing something wrong, I would
try to change my behavior. My impression is that the others consider
me fairly skilled and capable, and do not have any problem with my
communication.

Panu said my communication has been very good and versatile, and that things are
being brought up clearly. My communication also maybe improved during
the course. We all got more comfortable with each other.


## Sprint 2 (21.11 - 27.11)

Held the sprint planning meeting and split up work and tasks.

Updated some process tasks on Azure.

Updated Wiki entries:
- Retrospective, planning, daily scrum.

On Wednesday we held a planning meeting after the daily scrum.

On Thursday we met with our client, Jyri and the kids. We demoed the
game for them. They liked how our player character and zombies looked.
They also wanted us to add sounds to the game, which we were already
planning to do.

During this sprint we progressed the game mechanics a good bit.
Specifically the player character and zombie behavior.

We did not quite complete all tasks during the sprint, and realized we
need to consider the age rating of the game, as it is being created for
children.

On friday we had the teacher guidance meeting.

We will improve our usage of Azure, splitting tasks into smaller pieces
and planning better. We will also utilize the in-progress state more.

## Sprint 3 (28.11 - 04.12)

On Monday morning we held the daily scrum, sprint 2 retro, and sprint 3
plan. I chose and/or got assinged the job of creating the main menu for
our game. We settled in our roles and tasks quite well at this point.

On Wednesday we had another group planning session after the daily
scrum.

On Friday we held daily scrum as usual, and later had the weekly teacher
meeting.

I worked on the main menu camera transitions.

## Sprint 4 (05.12 - 11.12)

We held the scrum, retro and planning session on Monday. We improved our
use of DevOps since the last sprint, specifically the use of the
in-progress state, which we agreed to focus on. Division of work also
went well, and we completed tasks mostly on time. We also adapted to the
required age-rating. We still could plan the sprint better.

For my next tasks, I'm working on making the widgets interactive and
making the transitions work between menus. Each other member continues
work on their respective tasks. We also create the DoD for the sprint.

Halfway through the sprint, things were already progressing well and we
were approaching the DoD.

We also held the scrum meetings and weekly teacher meeting on time this
week.

## Sprint 5 (12.12 - 15.12)

Again, we had the scrum, retro and planning meetings.

We achieved and completed almost everything we planned to in our last
sprint. We also began work on the final boss. Everything went quite
well, and our use of DevOps improved again. Remaining work is being more
actively updated and also being better estimated.

We all kind of felt like we might have a bit more time for this project.
Ending on the 15th somehow came as a bit of a surprise for us, at least
it felt kind of sudden. We also could not meet our client this week, so
we plan to have a final meeting and deliver the product on the 19th.

I got the settings view added into the main menu. Also added a game
title, and 3D art in the background, though it is not quite finished
yet. The buttons are also better styled now.

I'm feeling good about everything, and the game is beginning to look
really nice.

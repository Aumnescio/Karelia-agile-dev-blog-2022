# Agile development dev-blog, 2022

Author: Herbert Salin, 2108822


## Wednesday, 26th October at 11:00 AM

I watched the first course lecture. Basic course information was
introduced, and apparently actual work is at least a week away. We do
not yet know what we are supposed to work on, or how exactly.

I would assume we do get to work on a game, hopefully using Unreal Engine 5.

I created a clockify workspace and project for the agile project.

-> Overall time spent: 1h 20 min


## Monday, 31st October at 09:45 AM

I watched the second lecture. Honestly, felt like mostly a waste of time.
We were vaguely introduced to the assignment we will be given. In my case,
presumably, I will be programming a game designed by children.

Updated clockify.

-> Overall time spent: 2h 30 min

## Tuesday, 8th November at 05:00 AM

I studied Scrum and the Scrum-master role for a couple hours in
preparation for the project starting.

I also read up on related emails and joined the Azure Dev Ops group. I
briefly looked at the tasks already listed there, and communicated with
my team, asking them what roles they would prefer. Currently there is
one member, Panu, still missing from our Discord server. I sent an invite
to him about a week ago.

I don't think the 1st sprint has officially started yet, even though
it's been about 2 weeks since the start of the course. Tomorrow, we
are probably going to get some guidance on what to do, and can begin
work. One of the first things to do will be to contact Jyri Martiskainen.

I am not quite sure what sort of collaboration we will have with
the children. Are we going to meet them weekly, or just once in the
beginning? I guess we will find out tomorrow. As of now, I also have no
idea what sort of game they might want us to make.

Updated clockify.

-> Overall time spent: 3h 57 min

## Wednesday, 9th November at 15:00 (03:00 PM)

Watched the lecture, it went over some Azure stuff. I feel okay about
using Azure.

At 13:30 our group held a meeting. Everyone was present.
- Herbert
- Jasu
- Jasper
- Panu
- Asmo

I reserved the Teams meeting date and time for our group on the 10th,
from 09:15 to 10:15. An email was sent to everyone involved. Everyone
accepted the invite.

Panu sent an email to Jyri, our client. We plan to meet on Monday (14th)
or Tuesday (15th) to discuss further.

We also received Admin rights to the Azure DevOps project. Planning the
tasks will begin once it is more clear to us what we need to do.

Updated clockify.

-> Overall time spent: 7h 17 min


## Sprint 0 (05.11 - 13.11)

This "sprint" has mostly been prep for the actual project.

- Agreed upon our roles.
    - Roles written in Azure Wiki.

Had the weekly meeting with teachers on the 10th.
- Wrote notes about the meeting.
- Moved my notes about it to the Azure Wiki on the 14th.

Updated clockify.

-> Overall time spent: 16h 59 min

### Contribution and commitment

#### My Tasks

I track the tasks I need to complete in my personal notes, and I spend
a number of hours completing the tasks.

#### Evenly split work

- Asmo will create background art.
- Jasper and Jasu will work on player and enemy characters.
- Panu is handling the Product Owner's tasks and will create the introduction for our game.
- I, Herbert, will oversee the other's work, and help where needed. I
am at least partially responsible for creating backlog items and tasks
in Azure. I also keep updating the Wiki, hold the daily scrum,
retrospective meetings and the sprint planning sessions, and will
help with programming the player character, items, and weapons. I
will attempt to keep the project organized and help in planning the
architecture.

#### Group guidelines and agreed upon plans

I keep note of dates and times when we are supposed to be having meetings
or such, I intend to be there on time, and if I can not attend a meeting
for some reason, I will contact my team.

#### Relationship of Work to Goals of Project

I try to keep my priorities aligned with the vision of the product. I
write each task with thought and intent, thinking of how to split work
in suitable chunks. I help the team make constant progress, and dissolve
any roadblocks by communicating with the team and working hard.

#### Equality in Distribution of Work

I believe we can share the workload quite evenly. So far, I might have
done the most, but I intend to push the others to work a bit more if I
see them slacking. I will not do or shoulder everything myself.

The first tasks have just recently been assigned, so it is hard to
judge the equality of the workloads. I will keep an eye on it and adjust
accordingly.

#### Other groups

I have no idea how to become familiar with other groups work. I have no
access to their group chats or Azure. I was under the impression that
we are not really communicating with the other teams.

#### Importance of My Work to Success of Project

I think my work is important. I can look at some graphs on Azure which
show that I contribute to the project. Creating good backlog items and
tasks can help the team progress faster.

#### Advancing Equality in Distribution of Work

If someone looks like they might not be working much, I will try to get
them to do something. I can assign some easy tasks to lessen the burden
of entry. If someone wants to maybe do more work, I don't discourage it.

Complete equality and fairness is an impossible goal. As long as everyone
does their part, the project will succeed. If anyone raises concerns
regarding the fairness in distribution, I will attempt to solve the
problem.

#### Implementing Behavior from Other Groups into Ours

I do not implement good practices from other groups, because we have no
idea what the others are doing.

### Work tracking

#### Tracking My Usage of Time

I track time using Clockify and I update the time on my Dev-Blog. I have
created multiple categories and tags on Clockify so that I can see where
time is being spent. For example, I track development, meeting, writing,
DevOps and lecture times separately.

The time spent of various tasks can be fetched from Clockify for the
duration of each sprint.

I have not enabled billing in Clockify, as I am not actually being
billed, I do not see it as relevant. Calculating the time afterwards is
also completely possible using a simple formula: *hours * hourly-pay*. I
also dislike the idea of pay per hour, which encourages working as much
as possible and lying about how much you've worked, while discouraging
and lowering the value of highly productive work.

### Reflektio

#### My Role

My role as the Scrum-master is to upkeep scrum within the team. I hold
the scrum, sprint retrospective, and sprint planning meetings. I also
work on scrum checklist and actively try to get my team to work more
effectively.

#### Scrum-master

I read about the Scrum-master role, and watched a number of videos on Youtube.

#### Responsibilities

#### How do you make sure you uphold your responsibilities?

I communicate actively with my team. I try to work hard. I don't want
to completely dissapoint people around me. I also want to get an okay
grade.

#### Areas with Room for Development

I do not know how to do better.

#### Strengths

I am active and skilled. My communication is hopefully okay.

### My Tasks

#### Tasks as Scrum-master

I hold the daily scrum, retrospective meetings and take part in sprint
planning. I keep updating the scrum process tasks on Azure. I communicate
with the team and help them out if they need any help. I also do a bit
of programming.

#### Keeping Track of Tasks

I write everything down. I mark tasks as TODO or DONE. Of course we also
actively use Azure DevOps, which allows us to track tasks.

#### Improving Based on Previous Experience

I learned a lot about scrum and agile practices, and about Azure DevOps.
I can utilize these tools more effectively now.

### Viestint√§

#### Contact with Group

I message the group every day on Discord, I update tasks on Azure and
I hold the daily scrum. I respond to the groups messages as soon as
possible.

I try to gauge how others react to my communication and adjust
accordingly. If they were to tell me I am doing something wrong, I would
try to change my behavior. My impression is that the others consider
me fairly skilled and capable, and do not have any problem with my
communication.

Panu said my communication has been very good and versatile, and that things are
being brought up clearly. My communication also maybe improved during
the course. We all got more comfortable with each other.


## Sprint 2 (21.11 - 27.11)

Held the sprint planning meeting and split up work and tasks.

Updated some process tasks on Azure.

Updated Wiki entries:
- Retrospective, planning, daily scrum.

On Wednesday we held a planning meeting after the daily scrum.

On Thursday we met with our client, Jyri and the kids. We demoed the
game for them. They liked how our player character and zombies looked.
They also wanted us to add sounds to the game, which we were already
planning to do.

During this sprint we progressed the game mechanics a good bit.
Specifically the player character and zombie behavior.

We did not quite complete all tasks during the sprint, and realized we
need to consider the age rating of the game, as it is being created for
children.

On friday we had the teacher guidance meeting.

We will improve our usage of Azure, splitting tasks into smaller pieces
and planning better. We will also utilize the in-progress state more.

## Sprint 3 (28.11 - 04.12)

On Monday morning we held the daily scrum, sprint 2 retro, and sprint 3
plan. I chose and/or got assigned the job of creating the main menu for
our game. We settled in our roles and tasks quite well at this point.

On Wednesday we had another group planning session after the daily
scrum.

On Friday we held daily scrum as usual, and later had the weekly teacher
meeting.

I worked on the main menu camera transitions.

## Sprint 4 (05.12 - 11.12)

We held the scrum, retro and planning session on Monday. We improved our
use of DevOps since the last sprint, specifically the use of the
in-progress state, which we agreed to focus on. Division of work also
went well, and we completed tasks mostly on time. We also adapted to the
required age-rating. We still could plan the sprint better.

For my next tasks, I'm working on making the widgets interactive and
making the transitions work between menus. Each other member continues
work on their respective tasks. We also create the DoD for the sprint.

Halfway through the sprint, things were already progressing well and we
were approaching the DoD.

On Friday, the 9th, I mostly finished the menu functionality. On Saturday,
with Panu, we cleaned up the remaining Scrum Checklist tasks. Some of
the checklist tasks did feel quite out-of-place, but we tried our best
to prove our activity by linking to things we had written and to the
Azure DevOps task backlogs.

We also held the scrum meetings and weekly teacher meeting on time this
week.

## Sprint 5 (12.12 - 15.12)

Again, we had the scrum, retro and planning meetings.

We achieved and completed almost everything we planned to in our last
sprint. We also began work on the final boss. Everything went quite
well, and our use of DevOps improved again. Remaining work is being more
actively updated and also being better estimated.

We all kind of felt like we might have a bit more time for this project.
Ending on the 15th somehow came as a bit of a surprise for us, at least
it felt kind of sudden. We also could not meet our client this week, so
we plan to have a final meeting and deliver the product on the 19th.

I got the settings view added into the main menu. Also added a game
title, and 3D art in the background, though it is not quite finished
yet. The buttons are also better styled now.

I'm feeling good about everything, and the game is beginning to look
really nice.

## Self and peer assesment

### Project member: Herbert Salin (Scrum-master)

1. General contribution to the project. (0-5)
    - In terms of contribution I would give myself a 4. I think I was
    probably the most active communicator, and most focused on the
    Scrum process, which was my priority task as Scrum-master. However,
    I did not contribute as much to developing the game as Jasper. He
    was very active in developing the game. I still contributed my part,
    and I helped others actively with issues we faced during the project.

2. Suitability of the role
    - The role fit me okay, I think. At least I don't feel bad about
    it. I can't say I feel the most passionate about Scrum, and maybe a
    number of times felt like there isn't really that much for me to do
    in terms of trying to "establish scrum". My contribution still
    helped the team focus on improving our process during the project. I
    lead planning each sprint, and gave the team direction. During
    sprint retrospectives I noted parts that could be improved, and most
    of the time our team did improve on the parts in the next sprint.

3. Success in the roles' work tasks
    - I already touched on this in the previous two sections. I think I
    succeeded quite well, and my team gave me positive feedback. I
    personally felt like I helped the team work better.

4. The member's strengths and weaknesses
    - I'm quite familiar with Unreal and game-development related things
    in general, which allows me to easily remove common roadblocks in
    game-development, like bugs, git conflicts, project architecture problems, and
    also lets me guide design decisions so that the teams doesn't make
    things unnecessarily difficult for themselves. I used to consider
    communication a weakness of mine, but while it isn't anywhere near
    flawless, I don't think my communication is too bad right now. I can
    be active and clear enough to be understood well.
    - As for things to improve; I don't think I spent that much time on
    the project, maybe I should have spent more. As I mentioned before,
    it really isn't clear to me what I could realistically do in terms
    of establishing or advancing scrum, in a small 5 man team, that
    would require more than 1 hour each day.

5. Personal work/task management (0-5)
    - I would grade my personal task management 4. My task management
    included the management of holding daily scrum, sprint retrospectives,
    sprint planning sessions, reserving the teacher meeting date, wiki
    writing, and documentation. We held the meeting at the same time
    very consistently.
    - In Azure DevOps, I created a number of tasks for myself,
    and actively estimated the remaining work on the tasks. Mostly I
    completed my tasks as planned. I also quite often added new tasks,
    as things progressed.
    - My work on the tasks was quite bursty. I preferred working in long
    bursts rather than for example, 1 hour a day consistently.

6. Contribution and commitment to the project (0-5)
    - I'd give myself a 4 in commitment. I did not spend as much time
    as I could have on the project, so my commitment to the project was
    not extremely strong. I was still very committed to my role and all
    my tasks. I did not miss any meetings, and contributed actively. I
    completed my development tasks, too. I took notes from all our
    meetings, and tried to get more out of my teammates.

7. Communication and messaging (0-5)
    - I'd give myself a 4+ in communication. I just would not say my
    communication was 5/5. Still, my team gave me positive feedback
    regarding my communication, and I think I was very active, both in
    meetings and in Discord chat, and also in my wiki documentation. I
    wrote nearly all of the Wiki, and I had more Discord messages sent
    than everyone else combined. I also lead our meetings and probably
    spoke the most.


### Project member: Panu Lehtonen (Product-owner)

1. General contribution to the project. (0-5)
    - Panu worked hard on the intro-animation. As Product-owner, he was
    not very active in terms of creating a product backlog. His
    communication with our client might have been a little bit lacking,
    considering how few meetings we had with them. He also admitted this
    himself, saying he probably should be sending emails earlier and
    more actively. I'd give Panu a 3.5 in terms of contribution.

2. Suitability of the role
    - I don't really know how to judge this. I feel like Panu mostly
    worked on the animation sequence in Blender, which was not
    the primary job of the product-owner. Maybe Panu struggled with
    creating the product backlog, and prioritising tasks. I don't think
    he addressed the product backlog at all during the project. I think
    I and the developers themselves mostly created and prioritised tasks
    ourselves. There was not necessarily a critical problem with this, but
    in terms of his Scrum Role, I don't think he fulfilled it very well.

3. Success in the roles' work tasks
    - Heavily touched on this in the section above. I would rate his
    success in his roles tasks very low. I don't think he focused on
    them at all, outside of emailing the client.

4. The member's strengths and weaknesses (things to improve)
    - Panu is pleasant to work with, and worked hard on the intro
    animation. He probably could have tried to focus on the tasks of
    his role a lot more. Not that it personally bothered me, but in
    terms of acting according to the scrum role, there was a lot left
    to be desired.

5. Personal work/task management (0-5)
    - Panu created and completed a couple development tasks for himself
    each sprint. His task management in terms of his role's job was not well
    executed. I'd grade his task management a 3.

6. Contribution and commitment to the project (0-5)
    - I don't feel like Panu's contribution to guiding the direction
    of the project was very big. His contribution to the game was the
    intro-animation, which conveyd a part of the project that the kids
    originally stressed; the story. I think he was committed to the
    project, but maybe in a way that was not completely aligned with
    his role. I'd give his contribution and commitment a grade of 3.5.

7. Communication and messaging (0-5)
    - Panu's communication is clear, but not very assertive or commanding,
    which maybe the product-owner should be. He is available, willing,
    and easy to communicate with. I'd give his communication a grade of 3.5.


### Project member: Asmo Turunen (Developer)

1. General contribution to the project. (0-5)
    - Asmo worked as a developer, and his assigned task was the background
    art. Most of his contribution was finding and importing a 3D scene
    with roads and buildings. I think he also chose and imported a couple
    megascans foliage assets. It took him quite a while to get the models
    into our project. The models imported also seem a bit broken, or
    badly architectured / packaged. I don't feel like his contribution
    was large. Anyone could have imported a couple megascans assets. I
    don't believe he did any programming. Most of the foliage painting
    was done by Jasper, too. I would give Asmo a grade of 2.

2. Suitability of the role
    - Considering how little it felt like he achieved, maybe the role or
    tasks were not well suited for him. However, I don't think his role
    was difficult, so I have no idea what role would have suited him
    better. I don't believe he expressed much interest in working on
    something else.

3. Success in the roles' work tasks
    - This was mostly covered in section 1.

4. The member's strengths and weaknesses (things to improve)
    - Maybe Asmo could improve his communication, if he encountered
    problems, but did not bring them up more. Or if he felt like he
    wanted to do something else, or if he did not know what exactly he
    should do. I don't know what strengths Asmo has.

5. Personal work/task management (0-5)
    - Asmo had very few tasks during the project, and I don't think Asmo's
    tasks were too difficult. He did eventually complete the tasks, but
    not many new tasks were assigned to him. He worked quite slow. I
    could not say his task management was good. I would give his task
    management a grade of 2.

6. Contribution and commitment to the project (0-5)
    - As discussed above, I think both his contribution and commitment
    to the project were the lowest in our group. Not being able to
    make progress for a number of weeks shows lack of commitment and
    also results in low contribution. I would give his contribution and
    commitment a grade of 2.

7. Communication and messaging (0-5)
    - Asmo had a total of 33 messages in Discord. I had 370+, Panu had
    90, Jasper had 78. Asmo was also relatively quiet during meetings,
    but not inactive. I would give his communication a grade of 2.


### Project member: Jasper Voutilainen (Developer)

1. General contribution to the project. (0-5)
    - Grade: 5
    - He worked very hard and did most of the gameplay related
    programming.

2. Suitability of the role
    - He seemed very well suited for his role. He enjoyed himself and
    produced good output. He had a good bit of previous experience.

3. Success in the roles' work tasks
    - He was very successful in his role. He created the player character
    functionality sucessfully, and also create a final boss.  He also
    worked on the visuals a good bit, and as a result, the game plays
    and looks nice.

4. The member's strengths and weaknesses (things to improve)
    - Jasper is hardworking and interested in game-development. Don't
    really know what he could improve.

5. Personal work/task management (0-5)
    - Grade: 4.5
    - Jasper managed his tasks independently on Azure. He created and
    completed many tasks in each sprint.

6. Contribution and commitment to the project (0-5)
    - Grade: 5
    - Jasper seemed very committed to the project. He probably spent the
    most time on development.

7. Communication and messaging (0-5)
    - Grade: 4.5
    - He communicated actively and clearly. The team was aware of what
    Jasper was doing most of the time. He took an active part in
    meetings too.


### Project member: Jasu Vihonen (Developer)

1. General contribution to the project. (0-5)
    - Grade: 3.75
    - Jasu worked on primarily on the zombie enemies. He got the zombies
    walking and attacking, but struggled a bit and needed help a number
    of times. He was brave enough to ask for help, which was good,
    and meant that he did not get stuck for weeks on the same problem.
    He get the models and animations for the zombies, but also needed
    some help getting them to work properly. He also found and added
    some sounds to the game.

2. Suitability of the role
    - Jasu might not have been very familiar with Unreal beforehand. He
    still managed to contribute and fulfill his role well enough. I
    think the role fit him fine.

3. Success in the roles' work tasks
    - While Jasu did not work completely independently, he was able to
    successfully complete his tasks and make progress each week.

4. The member's strengths and weaknesses (things to improve)
    - I like that Jasu was able to ask for help when he needed it. Maybe
    his weakness was just lacking experience.

5. Personal work/task management (0-5)
    - Jasu completed multiple tasks and I think his use of Azure DevOps
    was good. Though it might have taken some time to get used to.

6. Contribution and commitment to the project (0-5)
    - Grade: 3.5
    - Jasu's contribution was relevant, and he seemed committed. He
    didn't miss any meetings and took active part in discussions. He
    worked on a number of tasks and actively used Azure DevOps.

7. Communication and messaging (0-5)
    - Jasu's communication was okay, but not very active. He asked for
    help a number of times, which is good. He was about as active as
    the others during meetings, but not too active in Discord chat. I'd
    grade Jasu's communication a 3.5.
